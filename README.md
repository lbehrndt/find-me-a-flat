# Find Me a Flat (with ChatGpt) üè¢üîç

**Find Me a Flat** is your ultimate companion in the quest for the perfect apartment, powered by a web scraping technology. This project serves as a web scraper for the renowned platform [WG-Gesucht](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/), automating the search process to make apartment hunting a breeze. Here's how it works:

## Features

- **Adjustable search**: The program looks for listings based on your filters. By applying filters you will get the listings you want.
- **Automated messaging**: No need to message every single listing. The program does it for you. It adds the owners name too ;)
- **Personalized messages with ChatGpt (optional)**: Don't worry about being ignored, because you didn't write a personalized message.

## Usage

### 1. Automated Apartment Hunt

Specify the filters you want to use. For example: Berlin, flatshare, max. 500‚Ç¨. Enable the filters and copy the url into the `.env` file:

```env
FILTER_URL=https://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/wg-zimmer-in-Berlin.8.0.1.0.html?offer_filter=1&city_id=8&sort_order=0&noDeact=1&categories%5B%5D=0&rMax=500
```

### 2. Automated Contacting:

You will need to write a message template in German and English for this to work. You can add one here: [Message Templates](https://www.wg-gesucht.de/en/mein-wg-gesucht-message-templates.html).

> :warning: Add "@owner_name" to the locations you want to address the owner (e.g. Hi @owner_name! ‚û°Ô∏è Hi Sarah!)

Click on a template to copy the id from the url (...template_id=**12345678**) and add it to your `.env`:

```env
MESSAGE_ENG=YOUR-TEMPLATE-ID
MESSAGE_GER=YOUR-TEMPLATE_ID
```

The program will log you in to get necessary tokens and cookies, therefore needs your login details:

```env
WGG_USERNAME=YOUR-EMAIL # or username
WGG_PASSWORD=YOUR-PASSWORD
```

### 3. Personalized Messaging with ChatGPT (optional):

**Now to the fun part!**

I have added the ChatGPT API to this project to personalize your message to the listing. You will need to get a an API key from Open Ai for this. Create one here: [OpenAI Api Key](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys) and add it to the `.env`:

```
  OPENAI_API_KEY=REALLY-LONG-KEY
```

To make your message even more personalized, you can add some adjectives that describe your character. ChatGPT will take this into consideration and adjust the tonality:

```env
CHARACTER='open-minded,friendly'
```
